This was a first-pass at taking llm.c@2790d26 and translating into Zig to both familiarize myself with Zig and to try-hard transformers. 
Got busy with work and other projects. 


## TODO to wrap this up:
- Vectorizaton / SIMD support
- Training pass is borked
- Inference pass is half-borked
- Publish Obsidian notes
- Push heavily-annotated version

## Future
- lean numpy-like lib in Zig?
